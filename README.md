# ADSA-LAB
PROCEDURE FOR EVALUATION
Student will be evaluated for 100 marks based on following criteria
Labs involving implementation of theory subject and mini project
There will be 2 phases.
In first phase, continuous evaluation of the experiments conducted between Lab 1 and
Lab-8.
Continuous evaluation → for 40 marks
TWO evaluations→ Evaluation1:Lab-1 to Lab-4 (20Marks)
Evaluation2: Lab-5 to Lab-8 (20Marks)
Every evaluation carries 20 marks each
In the Second Phase, students will be working on Mini project between Week 9 to Week
11 based on the concept they have been taught in the theory. Any research paper may be
referred for this purpose. This will be evaluated for 20 Marks.
Mini Project →20 Marks

Final end semester Examination→ 40 Marks
